# Project768

A 2D platformer game built with Godot 4.3 featuring unique time rewind mechanics and spacetime manipulation.

## Overview

Project768 is an innovative 2D platformer that allows players to rewind time and manipulate the flow of gameplay. The game features multiple worlds, complex enemy AI, interactive objects, and a sophisticated save/load system. Players can reverse time to undo mistakes, solve puzzles, and explore temporal mechanics.

## Key Features

### üï∞Ô∏è Time Rewind System
- **Real-time rewind**: Hold Tab to rewind the game state
- **Variable speed**: Use Up/Down arrows during rewind to adjust speed
- **Audio synchronization**: Music plays forward and backward matching the time direction
- **State preservation**: All game objects maintain their historical states

### üåå Spacetime Mechanics
- **Directional gameplay**: Some elements behave differently when time flows backward
- **Spacetime entities**: Special enemies and objects with unique temporal behaviors
- **Dynamic audio**: Background music adapts to the current time flow direction

### üéÆ Gameplay Elements
- **Multiple worlds**: Explore different levels with unique challenges
- **Interactive objects**: Keys, locked doors, switches, boxes, and platforms
- **Enemy variety**: Regular enemies, spacetime enemies, and jumping enemies
- **Collectible system**: Items persist across game sessions
- **Environmental puzzles**: Use time manipulation to solve complex challenges

### üíæ Persistence System
- **Save/Load functionality**: Progress automatically saves
- **Cross-session persistence**: Collected items remain across play sessions
- **Scene-based saves**: Each level maintains independent progress

## Controls

| Action | Key | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Move | Arrow Keys | Move left/right, climb ladders |
| Jump | Space/Enter | Jump and interact |
| Rewind | Tab | Hold to rewind time |
| Speed Up | Up Arrow (during rewind) | Increase rewind speed |
| Slow Down | Down Arrow (during rewind) | Decrease rewind speed |
| Reload Scene | F5 | Restart current level |
| Quit | Escape | Exit the game |
| Interact | Space | Interact with objects |

## Architecture

### Core Systems

#### Rewind System
- **RewindPlayer**: Main controller for time manipulation
- **SpacetimeRewindPlayer**: Enhanced rewind with spacetime mechanics
- **IRewindable Interface**: Contract for objects that can be rewound
- **RewindDataSource**: Manages all rewindable entities in the scene

#### State Management
- **State Machine Pattern**: Used for complex entity behaviors
- **Save System**: Handles game progress persistence
- **Scene Management**: Smooth transitions between levels

#### Audio System
- **RewindAudioPlayer**: Synchronizes music with time flow
- **SpacetimeAudioPlayer**: Directional audio for spacetime mechanics
- **Dynamic Playback**: Forward and backward audio playback

### Entity System
All game entities implement relevant interfaces:
- `IRewindable`: For time manipulation
- `IStateMachineEntity`: For complex behaviors
- `IPersistentEntity`: For save/load functionality
- `IInteractableEntity`: For player interactions

## Game Worlds

The game features multiple worlds, each with unique challenges:

1. **World 0**: Tutorial and basic mechanics introduction
2. **World 1**: Core platforming with rewind puzzles
3. **World 2**: Advanced spacetime mechanics
4. **World 3**: Complex multi-layered temporal challenges

## Development

### Adding New Rewindable Objects
1. Implement the `IRewindable` interface
2. Add the object to the appropriate group in scene
3. Register in `RewindDataSource.cs`

### Creating New Levels
1. Create scene in `scenes/level/game/`
2. Add spawn points for player
3. Configure rewind system components
4. Set up save/load persistence
